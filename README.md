# EyesRest
Pops up a fullscreen window you can't close for twenty seconds every twenty minutes to let you rest your eyes while using a computer.

This is my first personal project, and I plan on using it myself because I don't like the other programs I've found that do basically the same thing. It's not polished or complete, but it does what I need it to do as is. I don't really intend for other people to use it, that's why I'm fine with the spartan interface and lack of ability to choose the frequency and duration of the breaks.

I plan on:
1. making pop up window fade in
2. style the main frame
3. put it in icon tray for minimization
4. include variable duration and frequency of breaks
